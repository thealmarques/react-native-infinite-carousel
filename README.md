# Infinite Carousel - React Native

Carousel component for React Native applications.

## Example

<img src="resources/demo.gif" height="40%" width="30%"/>

## How it works

The component has the following props
* Urls - Array containing the urls of the images

If the image array is greater than one then there will be possible to slide through images showing at the same time a slider container informing the user of the selected image.

## Installation

Run this command to install all dependencies of the project

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

Execute this command to start the expo server

```bash
expo start
```

Open your expo app on your phone or use a emulator to test the application.
